h1. puts "Putz!"

  When you are a web developer, you can never hide from writing a Javascript alert. When you are also a Rails developer, many times you need to debug something using @Kernel.puts@. This can lead you to worry about going back to delete that line or in the worst scenario, forgetting the line on the production code.
